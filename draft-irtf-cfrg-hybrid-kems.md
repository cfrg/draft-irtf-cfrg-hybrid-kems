--- abstract

This document defines generic constructions for hybrid Key Encapsulation
Mechanisms (KEMs) based on combining a traditional cryptographic component
and a post-quantum (PQ) KEM. Hybrid KEMs built using these constructions
provide strong security properties as long as either of the underlying
algorithms are secure.

# Introduction {#intro}

Post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic algorithms are based on
problems that are conjectured to be resistant to attacks possible on a quantum
computer. Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs), are a standardized class of
cryptographic scheme that can be used to build protocols in lieu of
traditional, quantum-vulnerable variants such as finite field or elliptic
curve Diffie-Hellman (DH) based protocols.

Given the novelty of PQ algorithms, however, there is some concern that PQ
algorithms currently believed to be secure will be broken.  Hybrid
constructions that combine both PQ and traditional algorithms can help
moderate this risk while still providing security against quantum attack.  If
construted properly, a hybrid KEM will retain certain security properties
even if one of the two constituent KEMs is compromised. If the PQ KEM is
broken, then the hybrid KEM should continue to provide security against
non-quantum attackers by virtue of its traditional KEM component. If the
traditional KEM is broken by a quantum computer, then the hybrid KEM should
continue to resist quantum attack by virtue of its PQ KEM component.

In addition to guarding against algorithm weaknesses, this property also
guards against flaws in implementations, such as timing attacks.  Hybrid KEMs
can also facilitate faster deployment of PQ security by allowing applications
to incorporate PQ algorithms while still meeting compliance requirements
based on traditional algorithms.

In this document, we define generic frameworks for constructing hybrid KEMs
from a traditional algorithm and a PQ KEM.  The aim of this document is
provide a small set of techniques to achieve specific security properties
given conforming component algorithms, which should make these techniques
suitable for a broad variety of use cases.

The remainder of this document is structured as follows: first, in
{{cryptographic-deps}} and {{frameworks}}, we define the abstractions on
which the frameworks are built, and then the frameworks themselves.  Then, in
{{security}}, we lay out the security analyses that support these frameworks,
including the security requirements for constituent components and the
security notions satisfied by hybrid KEMS constructed according to the
frameworks in the document {{security-requirements}}.  Finally, we discuss
some "path not taken", related topics that might be of interest to readers,
but which are not treated in depth.

# Requirements Notation

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Notation

This document is consistent with all terminology defined in
{{?I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.

The following terms are used throughout this document:

- `random(n)`: return a pseudorandom byte string of length `n` bytes produced
  by a cryptographically-secure random number generator.
- `concat(x0, ..., xN)`: Concatenation of byte strings.  `concat(0x01,
  0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- `split(N1, N2, x)`: Split a byte string `x` of length `N1 + N2` into its
  first `N1` bytes and its last `N2` bytes.  This function is the inverse of
  `concat(x1, x2)` when `x1` is `N1` bytes long and `x2` is `N2` bytes
  long. It is an error to call this function with a byte string that does not
  have length `N1 + N2`. Since this function operates over secret data `x`,
  it MUST be constant-time for a given `N1` and `N2`.

When `x` is a byte string, we use the notation `x[..i]` and `x[i..]` to
denote the slice of bytes in `x` starting from the beginning of `x` and
leading up to index `i`, including the `i`-th byte, and the slice the bytes
in `x` starting from index `i` to the end of `x`, respectively. For example,
if `x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `x[..2] = [0, 1]` and `x[2..] = [2, 3, 4]`.

A set is denoted by listing values in braces: `{a,b,c}`.

A vector of set elements of length `n` is denoted with exponentiation,
such as for the `n`-bit value: {0,1}<sup>n</sup>.

Drawing uniformly at random from an `n`-bit vector into a value `x`
is denoted: x $← {0,1}<sup>n</sup>.

A function `f` that maps from one domain to another is denoted
using a right arrow to separate inputs from outputs: f : inputs → outputs.

# Cryptographic Dependencies {#cryptographic-deps}

The generic hybrid PQ/T KEM frameworks we define depend on the the following
cryptographic primitives:

- Key Encapsulation Mechanisms ({{kems}})
- Nominal Groups ({{groups}})
- Pseudorandom Generators ({{prgs}})
- Key Derivation Functions ({{kdfs}})

In the remainder of this section, we describe functional aspects of these
mechanisms.  The security properties we require in order for the resulting
hybrid KEM to be secure are discussed in {{security}}.

A Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEMs) comprises the following algorithms:

- `GenerateKeyPair() -> (ek, dk)`: A randomized algorithm that generates a
  public encapsulation key `ek` and a secret decapsulation key `dk`, each of
  which are byte strings.
- `DeriveKeyPair(seed) -> (ek, dk)`: A deterministic algorithm that takes as
  input a seed `seed` and generates a public encapsulation key `ek` and a
  secret decapsulation key `dk`, each of which are byte strings.
- `Encaps(ek) -> (ct, ss)`: A probabilistic encapsulation
  algorithm, which takes as input a public encapsulation key `ek` and outputs
  a ciphertext `ct` and shared secret `ss`.
- `Decaps(dk, ct) -> ss`: A deterministic decapsulation algorithm, which
  takes as input a secret decapsulation key `dk` and ciphertext `ct` and
  outputs a shared secret `ss`.

We also make use of internal algorithms such as:

- `expandDecapsulationKey(dk) -> (ek, dk)`: A deterministic algorithm that
  takes as input a decapsulation key `dk` and generates keypair intermediate
  values for computation.

We assume that the values produced and consumed by the above functions are
all byte strings, with fixed lengths:

- `Nseed`: The length in bytes of a key seed
- `Nek`: The length in bytes of a public encapsulation key
- `Ndk`: The length in bytes of a secret decapsulation key
- `Nct`: The length in bytes of a ciphertext produced by Encaps
- `Nss`: The length in bytes of a shared secret produced by Encaps or Decaps

Nominal groups are an abstract model of elliptic curve groups, over which we
instantiate Diffie-Hellman key agreement {{ABH+21}}.  A nominal group
comprises a set `G` together with a distinguished basis element `g`, an
"exponentiation" map, and some auxiliary functions:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: An algorithm that produces an element `q` of `G` from an
  element `p` and an integer `x`.
    * The integers `x` are called "scalars" to distinguish them from group
      elements.
    * `Exp` must respect multiplication in its scalar argument `x`, so that
      `Exp(Exp(p, x), y) = Exp(p, x * y)`.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Produce a uniform pseudo-random scalar from the
  byte string `seed`.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(P) -> ss`: Extract a shared secret from an element of
  the group (e.g., by taking the X coordinate of an ellpitic curve point).

We assume that scalars and group elements are represented by byte strings with
fixed lengths:

- `Nseed`: The length in bytes of a seed (input to RandomScalar)
- `Nscalar`: The length in bytes of a scalar
- `Nelem`: The length in bytes of a serialized group element
- `Nss`: The length in bytes of a shared secret produced by
  ElementToSharedSecret

The security requirements for groups used with the frameworks in this document
are laid out in {{security-groups}}.

## Pseudorandom Generators {#prgs}

A pseudorandom generator (PRG) is a deterministic function `G` whose outputs
are longer than its inputs. When the input to `G` is chosen uniformly at
random, it induces a certain distribution over the possible output. The
output distribution is pseudorandom if it is indistinguishable from the
uniform distribution.

The PRGs used in this document have a simpler form, with a fixed
output lengths:

- `Nout` - The length in bytes of an output from this PRG.
- `PRG(seed) -> output`: Produce a byte string of length `Nout` from an input
  byte string `seed`.

The fixed sizes are for both security and simplicity.

MUST provide the bit-security required to source input randomness for PQ/T
components from a seed that is expanded to a output length, of which a subset
is passed to the component key generation algorithms.

The security requirements for PRGs used with the frameworks in this document are
laid out in {{security-prgs}}.

## Key Derivation Functions {#kdfs}

A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is a function that a function that produces
keying material based on an input secret and other information.

While KDFs in the literature can typically consume and produce byte strings of
arbitrary length, the KDFs used in this document have a simpler form, with a fixed
output lengths:

- `Nout` - The length in bytes of an output from this KDF.
- `KDF(input) -> output`: Produce a byte string of length `Nout` from an input
  byte string.

The fixed sizes are for both security and simplicity.

For instances of the `Extract()`/`Expand()` KDF paradigm such as `HKDF`, we fix
the salt and sizes to fit this form.

The security requirements for KDFs used with the frameworks in this document are
laid out in {{security-kdfs}}.

# Hybrid KEM Frameworks {#frameworks}

In this section, we define three generic frameworks for building for hybrid
KEMs:

GHP:
: A generic framework that is suitable for use with any choice of traditional and
  PQ KEMs, with minimal security assumptions on the constituent KEMs

PRE:
: A performance optimization of GHP for the case where encapsulation keys are
  large and frequently reused

QSF:
: An optimized generic framework for the case where the traditional component is a
  nominal group and the PQ component has strong binding properties

These frameworks share a common overall structure, differing mainly in how they
compute the final shared secret and the security requirements of their
components.

## GHP {#ghp}

The GHP hybrid KEM depends on the following constituent
components:

* `KEM_T`: A traditional KEM
* `KEM_PQ`: A post-quantum KEM
* `PRG`: A PRG producing byte strings of length `KEM_T.Nseed + KEM_PQ.Nseed`
  (`PRG.Nout == KEM_T.Nseed + KEM_PQ.Nseed`)
* `KDF`: A KDF producing byte strings of length `GHP.Nss` (`KDF.Nout
  == GHP.Nss`)
* `Label` - A byte string used to label the specific combination of the above
  constituents being used.

The KEMs, groups, KDFs, and PRGs MUST meet the security requirements in
{{security-requirements}}.

The constants associated with the hybrid KEM are mostly derived from the
concatenation of keys and ciphertexts:

~~~
Nek = KEM_T.Nek + KEM_PQ.Nek
Ndk = KEM_T.Ndk + KEM_PQ.Ndk
Nct = KEM_T.Nct + KEM_PQ.Nct
~~~

The `Nseed` and `Nss` constants should reflect the overall security level of the
combined KEM, with the following recommended values:

~~~
Nseed = max(KEM_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed)
Nss = min(KEM_T.Nss, KEM_PQ.Nss)
~~~

Given these constituent parts, the GHP hybrid KEM is defined as
follows:

~~~
def expandDecapsulationKey(seed):
    seed_full = PRG(seed)
    (seed_T, seed_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed, seed_full)

def DeriveKeyPair(seed):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ, dk_T, dk_PQ) = expandDecapsulationKey(seed)
    return (concat(ek_T, ek_PQ), seed)

def GenerateKeyPair():
    seed = random(Nseed)
    return DeriveKeyPair(seed)

def Encaps(ek):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nek, KEM_PQ.Nek, ek)
    (ss_T, ct_T) = KEM_T.Encap(pk_T)

    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ek_PQ, ek_T, label))
    return ss_H
~~~

## PRE  {#pre}

The PRE hybrid KEM is a performance optimization of the GHP KEM,
optimized for the case where encapsulation keys are large and frequently
reused. In such cases, hashing the entire encapsulation key is expensive, and
the same value is hashed repeatedly.  The PRE KEM thus computes an
intermediate hash of the hybrid encapsulation key, so that the hash value can
be computed once and used across many encapsulation or decapsulation
operations.

The PRE KEM is identical to the GHP KEM except for the
shared secret computation.  One additional KDF is required:

* `KeyHash`: A KDF producing byte strings of length `GHP.Nss` (`KeyHash.Nout
  == GHP.Nss`)

The `GenerateKeyPair` and `DeriveKeyPair` algorithms for PRE are
identical to those of the GHP KEM.  The `Encaps` and `Decaps`
method use a modified shared secret computation:

~~~
def Encaps(ek):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nek, KEM_PQ.Nek, ek)
    (ss_T, ct_T) = KEM_T.Encap(pk_T)
    (ss_PQ, ct_PQ) = KEM_PQ.Encap(pk_PQ)

    ekh = KeyHash(concat(ek_T, ek_PQ))
    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ekh, label))

    ct_H = concat(ct_T, ct_PQ)
    return (ss_H, ct_H)

def Decaps(dk, ct):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ, dk_T, dk_PQ) = expandDecapsulationKey(dk)

    (ct_T, ct_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nct, KEM_PQ.Nct, ct)
    ss_T = KEM_T.Decap(dk_T, ct_T)
    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ekh = KeyHash(concat(ek_T, ek_PQ))
    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ekh, label))
    return ss_H
~~~

## QSF {#qsf}

The QSF hybrid KEM (QSF below) depends on the following constituent
components:

* `Group_T`: A nominal group
* `KEM_PQ`: A post-quantum KEM
* `PRG`: A PRG producing byte strings of length `Group_T.Nseed +
  KEM_PQ.Nseed` (`Expand.Nout == Group_T.Nseed + KEM_PQ.Nseed`)
* `KDF`: A KDF producing byte strings of length `QSF.Nss` (`KDF.Nout
  == KDF.Nss`)
* `Label` - A byte string used to label the specific combination of the above
  constituents being used.

We presume that `Group_T`, `KEM_PQ`, and the KDFs meet the interfaces
described in {{cryptographic-deps}} and MUST meet the security requirements
described in {{security-requirements}}.

The constants associated with the hybrid KEM are mostly derived from the
concatenation of keys and ciphertexts:

~~~
Nek = Group_T.Nelem + KEM_PQ.Nek
Ndk = Group_T.Nscalar + KEM_PQ.Ndk
Nct = Group_T.Nelem + KEM_PQ.Nct
~~~

The `Nseed` and `Nss` constants should reflect the overall security level of
the combined KEM, with the following recommended values:

~~~
Nseed = max(Group_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed)
Nss = min(Group_T.Nss, KEM_PQ.Nss)
~~~

Given these constituent parts, we define the QSF hybrid KEM as follows:

~~~
def expandDecapsulationKey(seed):
    seed_full = PRG(seed)
    (seed_T, seed_PQ) = split(Group_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed, seed)

    dk_T = Group_T.RandomScalar(seed_T)
    ek_T = Group_T.Exp(Group_T.g, dk_T)
    (ek_PQ, dk_PQ) = KEM_PQ.DeriveKeyPair(seed_PQ)

    return (ek_T, ek_PQ, dk_T, dk_PQ)

def DeriveKeyPair(seed):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ, dk_T, dk_PQ) = expandDecapsulationKey(seed)
    return (concat(ek_T, ek_PQ), seed)

def GenerateKeyPair():
    seed = random(Nseed)
    return DeriveKeyPair(seed)

def Encaps(ek):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ) = split(Group_T.Nek, KEM_PQ.Nek, ek)

    sk_E = Group_T.RandomScalar(random(GroupT.Nseed))
    ct_T = Group_T.Exp(GroupT.g, sk_E)
    ss_T = Group_T.ElementToSharedSecret(Group_T.Exp(ek_T, sk_E))
    (ss_PQ, ct_PQ) = KEM_PQ.Encap(ek_PQ)

    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_T, ek_T, Label))
    ct_H = concat(ct_T, ct_PQ)
    return (ss_H, ct_H)

def Decaps(dk, ct):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ, dk_T, dk_PQ) = expandDecapsulationKey(dk)

    ss_T = Group_T.ElementToSharedSecret(Group_T.Exp(ct_T, dk_T))
    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_T, ek_T, Label))
    return ss_H
~~~

# Security Considerations {#security}

Hybrid KEM constructions aim to provide security by combining two or more
schemes so that security is preserved if all but one schemes are replaced by
an arbitrarily bad scheme. Informally, these hybrid KEMs are secure if the
`KDF` is secure, and either the traditional component is secure, or the
post-quantum KEM is secure: this is the 'hybrid' property. Next we describe
this document's specific security goals for hybrid KEMs.

## Cryptographic Security Goals for Hybrid KEMs {#security-properties}

### IND-CCA Security {#ind-cca}

The first goal we have for our hybrid KEM constructions is
indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, or
IND-CCA. This is most common security goal for KEMs and public-key
encryption.

For KEMs, IND-CCA requires that no efficient adversary, given a ciphertext
obtained by running `Encaps()` with an honestly-generated public key, can
distinguish whether it is given the "real" secret output from `Encaps()`, or a
random string unrelated to the `Encaps()` call that created that
ciphertext. (Readers should note that this definition is slightly different
than the corresponding one for public-key encryption {{RS92}}.)

## Binding Properties {#binding-properties}

It is often useful for a KEM to have certain "binding" properties, by which
certain parameters determine certain others. Recent work {{CDM23}} gave a
useful framework of definitions for these binding properties. Binding for
KEMs is related to other properties for KEMs and public-key encryption, such
as robustness {{GMP22}} {{ABN10}}, and collision-freeness {{MOHASSEL10}}.

The framework given by {{CDM23}} refers to these properties with labels of
the form X-BIND-P-Q.  The first element X is the attack model---HON, LEAK, or
MAL.  P,Q means that given the value P, it is hard to produce another Q that
causes Decaps to succeed.  For example, LEAK-BIND-K-PK means that for a given
shared secret (K), there is a unique encapsulation key (PK) that could have
produced it, even if all of the secrets involved are given to the adversary
after the encapsulation operation is completed (LEAK).

We treat LEAK-BIND-K-PK and LEAK-BIND-K-CT to be target binding properties.
The HON-BIND security model seems too weak for real applications---real
attacks in the LEAK model are known {{BJKS24}} {{FG24}}. We are not aware
of any common settings where the MAL-BIND security model is needed; thus,
LEAK-BIND seems a sensible middle ground.

The LEAK-BIND-K-PK and LEAK-BIND-K-CT properties independently allow using
a KEM shared secret such that the likelihood of finding a colliding value with the
encapsulation key used in its computation or the ciphertext used in its
computation is negligible. Such properties are attractive when integrating
KEMs into protocols where once protocol designers would have used
Diffie-Hellman, as they can use the smaller shared secret value alone as an
input to a protocol key schedule for example, without necessarily also needing
to include the much larger ciphertext or the encapsulation key to be
protected against key confusion attacks {{FG24}} or KEM re-encapsulation
attacks {{BJKS24}}. Protocol designers may still need or want to include the
ciphertext or encapsulation key into their protocol or key schedule for other
reasons, but that can be independent of the specific properties of the KEM
and its resulting shared secret.

Implementors should not interpret the paragraph above as absolving them
of their responsibility to carefully think through whether MAL-BIND attacks
apply in their settings.

## Security Non-goals for Hybrid KEMs {#non-goals}

Security properties that were considered and not included in these designs:

Anonymity {{GMP22}}, Deniability, Obfuscation, other forms of key-robustness
or binding {{GMP22}}, {{CDM23}}

<!-- todo: distinguish key binding from the things we call X-BIND-K-[CT/PK]
above but haven't explained yet -->

## Security Requirements for Constituent Components {#security-requirements}

### Security Requirements for KEMs {#security-kems}

Component KEMs MUST be IND-CCA-secure {{GHP2018}} {{XWING}}.

For instances of QSF, the component KEM MUST also be ciphertext second
preimage resistant (C2PRI) {{XWING}}: this allows the component KEM
encapsulation key and ciphertext to be left out from the KDF input.

#### Ciphertext Second Preimage Resistant (C2PRI) Security {#c2pri}

Roughly, C2PRI {{XWING}} says that an adversary given an honestly-generated
key pair (sk, pk) and the result of an *honest* Encaps(pk) - call it k, c -
cannot find a _distinct_ c' such that Decaps(sk, c') = k. A related notion has
also been described as chosen-ciphertext resistance (CCR) {{CDM23}}. C2PRI targets
preimage-resistance, whereas CCR targets collision-resistance {{CAMPBELL25}}.

### Security Requirements for Groups {#security-groups}

The groups MUST be modelable as nominal groups in which the strong
Diffie-Hellman problem holds {{ABH+21}} {{XWING}}.

Prime-order groups such as P-256, P-384, and P-521 and the Montgomery curves
Curve25519 and Curve448 have been shown to be modelable as nominal groups in
{{ABH+21}}, as well as showing the `X25519()` and `X448()` functions
respectively pertain to the nominal group `exp(X, y)` function, specifically
clamping secret keys when they are generated, instead of clamping secret keys
together with exponentiation.

### Security Requirements for KDFs {#security-kdfs}

The KDF MUST be indifferentiable from a random oracle (RO) {{MRH03}}, even to
a quantum attacker {{BDFL+10}} {{ZHANDRY19}}.  This is a conservative choice
given a review of the existing security analyses for our hybrid KEM
constructions.  (In short, most IND-CCA analyses require only that the KDF is
some kind of pseudorandom function, but the SDH-based IND-CCA analysis of QSF
in {{XWING}} relies on the KDF being a RO. Proofs of our target binding
properties for our hybrid KEMs require the KDF is a collision-resistant
function.)

If the KDF is a RO, the key derivation step in the hybrid KEMs can be viewed
as applying a (RO-based) pseudorandom function - keyed with the shared
secrets output by the constituent KEMs - to the other inputs. Thus, analyses
which require the KDF to be a PRF, such as the one given in GHP {{GHP2018}}
or the standard-model analysis of QSF in {{XWING}}, apply.

Sponge-based constructions such as SHA-3 have been shown to be
indifferentiable against classical {{BDP+08}} as well as quantum adversaries
{{ACM+25}}.

HKDF has been shown to be indifferentiable from a random oracle under
specific constraints {{LBB20}}:

- that HMAC is indifferentiable from a random oracle,
which for HMAC-SHA-256 has been shown in {{DRS+13}}, assuming the
compression function underlying SHA-256 is a random oracle,
which it is indifferentiably when used prefix-free.

- the values of `HKDF`'s `IKM` input do not collide with
values of `info` `||` `0x01`. This MUST be enforced by the
concrete instantiations that use `HKDF` as its KDF.

The choice of the KDF security level SHOULD be made based on the
security level provided by the constituent KEMs. The KDF SHOULD
at least have the security level of the strongest constituent KEM.

### Security Requirements for PRGs {#security-prgs}

The functions used to expand a key seed to multiple key seeds is closer to a
pseudorandom generator (PRG) in its security requirements {{AOB+24}}.  A
secure PRG is an algorithm PRG : {0, 1}<sup>n</sup> → {0, 1}<sup>m</sup>,
such that no polynomial-time adversary can distinguish between PRG(r) (for r
$← {0, 1}<sup>n</sup>) and a random z $← {0, 1}<sup>m</sup> {{Rosulek}}.  The
uniform string r ∈ {0, 1}<sup>n</sup> is called the seed of the PRG.

A PRG is not to be confused with a random (or pseudorandom) _number_
generator (RNG): a PRG requires the seed randomness to be chosen uniformly
and extend it; an RNG takes sources of noisy data and transforms them into
uniform outputs.

PRGs are related to extendable output functions (XOFs) which can be
built from random oracles. Examples include SHAKE256.

### Security Properties of PRE {#security-pre}

The PRE hybrid KEM framework uses a function `KeyHash` to generate a short
digest of the encapsulation keys.  This function MUST be collision-resistant.

## Security Properties of Hybrid KEMs Frameworks

### IND-CCA analyses

The QSF construction has two complementary IND-CCA analyses. Both were given
in {{XWING}}. We summarize them but elide some details.

One analysis (Theorem 1) {{XWING}} shows that if the KDF is modelled as a RO,
IND-CCA holds if the PQ KEM is broken, as long as the SDH problem holds in
the nominal group and the PQ KEM satisfies C2PRI. The other (Theorem 2)
{{XWING}} shows that if the PQ-KEM is IND-CCA and the KDF is a PRF keyed on
the PQ-KEM's shared secret, IND-CCA holds.

As long as the aforementioned security requirements of the component parts
are met, these analyses imply that this document's QSF construction satisfies
IND-CCA security.

This document's exact GHP and PRE constructions do not have IND-CCA analyses;
the GHP paper gives a slightly different version, namely they do not include
the public encapsulation keys in the KDF. However, we argue that the proof
goes through with trivial modifications if the public encapsulation keys are
included in the KDF. The relevant step is claim 3 of Theorem 1, which reduces
to the split-key pseudorandomness of the KDF. (GHP call the KDF a "core"
function, and denote it as W.) We observe that adding the public
encapsulation keys to the inputs only changes the concrete contents of the
reduction's queries to its oracle. Since the reduction chooses the public
encapsulation keys itself, they can be added to the oracle inputs, and the
remainder of the proof goes through unmodified.

We also argue that this extension applies, again with nearly trivial
modifications, to prove security of PRE. Observe that the only difference
between GHP and PRE is prehashing of the public encapsulation keys. As long
as the hash function is collision-resistant, any event that happens in the
IND-CCA game of GHP happens only with negligibly different probability in the
IND-CCA game of PRE.

We reiterate that modulo some low-level technical details, our requirement
that the KDF is indifferentiable from an RO implies that, in the ROM, the KDF
used in GHP and PRE meets the split-key pseudorandomness property used in
GHP's analysis. <!-- TODO: apparently there is no good citation for this
foklore, maybe we can explicitly lay it out -->

Therefore all three hybrid KEMs in this document are IND-CCA when
instantiated with cryptographic components that meet the security
requirements described above. Any changes to the algorithms, including key
generation/derivation, are not guaranteed to produce secure results.

### Binding analyses

There are three hybrid KEM frameworks, and two target binding properties, so
we need six total analyses. None of these exact results were known; thus the
following are new results by the editorial team. We include informal
justifications here and defer rigorous proofs to a forthcoming paper.

We note that these sketches implicitly ignore the fact that in our hybrid
KEMs, both key pairs are derived from a common random seed; we instead
implicitly think of them as two runs of DeriveKeyPair with independent random
seeds.  We justify this simplification by noting that in the LEAK model - in
which the adversary is given the key pairs resulting from an honest run of
KeyGen - the pseudorandomness of the seed expansion implies the adversary's
input distributions in the two cases are computationally
indistinguishable. The derivation of component scheme key pairs from the
common random seed provides further protection against manipulation or
corruption of keys such that it can contribute to stronger binding properties
against a MAL adversary, as well as operational benefits in practice, but we
do not prove that here. <!-- TODO: if we can prove MAL for some of these,
should we do that here? OTherwise we should link to the QSF MAL-BIND proofs
in the X-Wing eprint, if we ever get that updated... -->

#### GHP Binding

##### LEAK-BIND-K-CT of GHP

Claim: If KDF is collision-resistant, then GHP is LEAK-BIND-K-CT.

Justification: To win LEAK-BIND-K-CT, given knowledge of two
honestly-generated GHP secret keys, the adversary must construct two distinct
GHP ciphertexts that decapsulate to the same (non-bot) key. Since GHP
includes the ciphertexts in the key derivation, the condition that the
ciphertexts are distinct directly implies that a LEAK-BIND-K-CT win gives a
collision in the KDF.

#### LEAK-BIND-K-PK of GHP

Claim: If KDF is collision-resistant, then GHP is LEAK-BIND-K-PK.

Justification: As described above, in the LEAK-BIND-K-PK game, to win the
adversary must construct two ciphertexts that decapsulate to the same non-bot
key, for distinct GHP public keys. Again, since GHP includes the public keys
in the KDF, the distinctness condition implies a LEAK-BIND-K-PK win must
collide the KDF.

#### PRE Binding

##### LEAK-BIND-K-CT of PRE

Claim: If KDF is collision-resistant, then PRE is LEAK-BIND-K-CT.

Justification: PRE and GHP do not differ on how they incorporate the
ciphertexts into key derivation, so the GHP proof above applies.

##### LEAK-BIND-K-PK of PRE

Claim: If KDF and KeyHash are collision-resistant, then PRE is
LEAK-BIND-K-PK.

Justification: The only relevant difference between PRE and GHP is key
prehashing. This does indeed change the proof, since we can no longer argue
the distinctness condition on the public keys _directly_ gives a collision in
KDF - the keys are hashed, and only their hash is input into the
KDF. However, as long as KeyHash is collision-resistant, the distinctness
condition implies the public key hashes are distinct. Thus, for the adversary
to win it must either collide KeyHash or KDF.

#### QSF Binding

The LEAK-BIND proofs for QSF are a bit more subtle than for GHP and PRE; the
main reason for this is QSF's omission of the PQ KEM key and ciphertext from
the KDF. We will show that QSF still has our target LEAK-BIND properties as
long as the underlying PQ-KEM also has the corresponding LEAK-BIND
property. We note that our preliminary results suggest a different proof
strategy, which instead directly uses properties of the nominal group, may
work here; we present the PQ-KEM route for concreteness.

##### LEAK-BIND-K-CT of QSF

Claim: If KDF is collision-resistant and the PQ KEM is LEAK-BIND-K-CT, then
QSF is LEAK-BIND-K-CT.

Justification: To win the adversary must construct two distinct QSF
ciphertexts that decapsulate to the same non-bot key.  Call the QSF
ciphertexts output by the adversary (ct_T^0, ct_PQ^0) and (ct_T^1,
ct_PQ^1). Distinctness implies (ct_T^0, ct_PQ^0) != (ct_T^1, ct_PQ^1). Since
ct_T is included in the KDF, if ct_T^0 != ct_T^1, a win must collide the KDF.

Thus we can restrict attention to the case where ct_PQ^0 != ct_PQ^1 but
ct_T^0 = ct_T^1. In this case, there are two relevant sub-cases: either
ss_PQ^0 (:= KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ^0, ct_PQ^0)) is not equal to ss_PQ^1 (:=
KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ^1, ct_PQ^1), or they are equal. If they are not equal, the
KDF inputs are again distinct, so a LEAK-BIND-K-CT win must collide the KDF.

If ss_PQ^0 = ss_PQ^1, we can show a reduction to the LEAK-BIND-K-CT security
of the PQ KEM. The reduction is given two PQ KEM key pairs as input and must
output two distinct PQ KEM ciphertexts that decapsulate to the same key. The
reduction does this by generating two nominal-group key pairs and running the
QSF LEAK-BIND-K-CT adversary on all keys. Then the reduction outputs the PQ
KEM ciphertexts output by the adversary. The probability that the adversary
wins and ss_PQ^0 = ss_PQ^1 and ct_PQ^0 != ct_PQ^1 and ct_T^0 = ct_T^1 is a
lower bound on the probability of the reduction winning the LEAK-BIND-K-CT
game against the PQ KEM.

We conclude by noting these cases are exhaustive.

##### LEAK-BIND-K-PK of QSF

Claim: If KDF is collision-resistant and the PQ KEM is LEAK-BIND-K-PK, then
QSF is LEAK-BIND-K-PK.

Justification: Similar to the above, we proceed by a case analysis on the win
condition of the LEAK-BIND-K-PK game.  The condition is (ek_T^0, ek_PQ^0) !=
(ek_T^1, ek_PQ^1) and ss_H^0 = ss_H^1. Again, as above we argue that the only
nontrivial case is the one where ek_PQ^0 != ek_PQ^1 but ek_T^0 = ek_T^1: in
the other case we can directly get a KDF collision from a winning output. In
this case the result of KEM_PQ.Decap for the two PQ KEM keys can either be
the same or different. IF they are different, we again get a KDF collision
from a win. If they are the same, in a similar way as above, we can build a
reduction to the LEAK-BIND-K-PK of PQ KEM.

Again, we conclude by noting that these cases are exhaustive.

## Other Considerations

### Domain Separation {#domain-separation}

ASCII-encoded bytes provide oracle cloning {{BDG2020}} in the security game
via domain separation. The IND-CCA security of hybrid KEMs often relies on
the KDF function `KDF` to behave as an independent random oracle, which the
inclusion of the `label` achieves via domain separation {{GHP2018}}.

By design, the calls to `KDF` in these frameworks and usage anywhere else
in higher level protocol use separate input domains unless intentionally
duplicating the 'label' per concrete instance with fixed paramters. This
justifies modeling them as independent functions even if instantiated by the
same KDF. This domain separation is achieved by using prefix-free sets of
`label` values. Recall that a set is prefix-free if no element is a prefix of
another within the set.

Length diffentiation is sometimes used to achieve domain separation but as a
technique it is brittle and prone to misuse {{BDG2020}} in practice so we
favor the use of an explicit post-fix label.

### Fixed-length

Variable-length secrets are generally dangerous. In particular, using key
material of variable length and processing it using hash functions may result
in a timing side channel. In broad terms, when the secret is longer, the hash
function may need to process more blocks internally. In some unfortunate
circumstances, this has led to timing attacks, e.g. the Lucky Thirteen
[LUCKY13] and Raccoon [RACCOON] attacks.

Furthermore, [AVIRAM] identified a risk of using variable-length secrets when
the hash function used in the key derivation function is no longer
collision-resistant.

If concatenation were to be used with values that are not fixed-length, a
length prefix or other unambiguous encoding would need to be used to ensure
that the composition of the two values is injective and requires a mechanism
different from that specified in this document.

Therefore, this specification MUST only be used with algorithms which have
fixed-length shared secrets.

# In Scope

## GHP Framework

The GHP framework works for generic IND-CCA component schemes. GHP also has
an IND-CCA proof from {{GHP2018}}. Including the public encapsulation keys as
part of the KDF preimage fits in the 'additional data' parts of the split key
PRF proof there, and binds to the encapsulation keys, which is a nice
property for protocols integrating concrete instances. GHP also matches NIST
SP 800-227 IPD, and gives good binding properties {{binding-properties}} is
generally safe with no caveats on use for constructing concrete instances
using a broad array of components.

## QSF Framework

QSF works for most elliptic curve groups and C2PRI-secure quantum-resistant
KEMs.  It is an optimization that leaves out large ciphertexts and
encapsulation keys from the KDF preimage, saving extra hashing, if the PQ KEM
meets requirements. More KEMs can be proven to be C2PRI-secure eventually for
use with QSF.

## PRE Framework

PRE offers many of the same benefits as GHP, while allowing an optimization
to pre-hash static encapsulation keys, which if large, can be a performance
improvement.

# Out of Scope

Considerations that were considered and not included in these designs:

Anonymity {{GMP22}}, Deniability, Obfuscation, other forms of key-robustness
or binding {{GMP22}}, {{CDM23}}

## More than Two Component KEMs

Design team decided to restrict the space to only two components, a
traditional and a post-quantum KEM.

## Parameterized Output Length

Not analyzed as part of any security proofs in the literature, and a
complicatation deemed unnecessary.

# Deterministic Encapsulation

When verifying the behavior of a KEM implementation (e.g., by generating or
verifying test vectors), it is useful for the implementation to expose a
"derandomized" version of the `Encaps` algorithm:

- `EncapsDerand(ek, randomness) -> (ct, shared_secret)`: A deterministic
   encapsulation algorithm, which takes as input a public encapsulation key
   `ek` and randomness `randomness`, and outputs a ciphertext `ct` and shared
   secret `shared_secret`.

An implementation that exposes `EncapsDerand` must also define a required
amount of randomness:

- `Nrandom`: The length in bytes of the randomness provided to EncapsDerand

The corresponding change for a nominal group is to replace randomly-generated
inputs to `RandomScalar` with deterministic ones.  In other words, for a
nominal group, `Nrandom = Nseed`.

When a hybrid KEM is instantiated with constituents that support derandomized
encapsulation (either KEMs or groups), the hybrid KEM can also support
`EncapsDerand()`, with `Nrandom = T.Nrandom + PQ.Nrandom`.  The structure of
the hybrid KEM's `EncapsDerand` algorithm is the same as its `Encaps` method,
with the following differences:

* The `EncapsDerand` algorithm also takes a `randomness` parameter, which is a
  byte string of length `Nrandom`.
* Invocations of `Encaps` or `RandomScalar` (with a random input) in the constituent
  algorithms are replaced with calls to `EncapsDerand` or `RandomScalar` with a
  deterministic input.
* The randomness used by the traditional constituent is the first `T.Nrandom`
  bytes of the input randomness.
* The randomness used by the PQ constituent is the final `PQ.Nrandom` bytes of
  the input randomness.
