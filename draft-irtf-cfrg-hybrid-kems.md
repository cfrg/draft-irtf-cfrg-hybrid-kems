  # XWING-EC-PROOF: https://github.com/formosa-crypto/formosa-x-wing/

--- abstract

Post-quantum (PQ) algorithms are designed to resist attack by a quantum
computer, in contrast to "traditional" algorithms.  However, given the
novelty of PQ algorithms, there is some concern that PQ algorithms currently
believed to be secure will be broken.  Hybrid constructions that combine both
PQ and traditional algorithms can help moderate this risk while still
providing security against quantum attack. In this document, we define
schemes for constructing hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) based on
combining a traditional KEM and a PQ KEM. Hybrid KEMs built using these
schemes provide strong security properties as long as the undelying
algorithms are secure.

# Introduction {#intro}

Post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic algorithms are based on
problems that are conjectured to be resistant to attacks possible on a quantum
computer. Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs), are a standardized class of
cryptographic scheme that can be used to build protocols in lieu of
traditional, quantum-vulnerable variants such as finite field or elliptic
curve Diffie-Hellman (DH) based protocols.

Given the novelty of PQ algorithms, however, there is some concern that PQ
algorithms currently believed to be secure will be broken.  Hybrid
constructions that combine both PQ and traditional algorithms can help
moderate this risk while still providing security against quantum attack.  If
construted properly, a hybrid KEM will retain certain security properties
even if one of the two constituent KEMs is compromised. If the PQ KEM is
broken, then the hybrid KEM should continue to provide security against
non-quantum attackers by virtue of its traditional KEM component. If the
traditional KEM is broken by a quantum computer, then the hybrid KEM should
continue to resist quantum attack by virtue of its PQ KEM component.

In addition to guarding against algorithm weaknesses, this property also
guards against flaws in implementations, such as timing attacks.  Hybrid KEMs
can also facilitate faster deployment of PQ security by allowing applications
to incorporate PQ algorithms while still meeting compliance requirements
based on traditional algorithms.

In this document, we define generic schemes for constructing hybrid KEMs from
a traditional algorithm and a PQ KEM.  The aim of this document is provide a
small set of techniques to achieve specific security properties given
conforming component algorithms, which should make these techniques suitable
for a broad variety of use cases.

The remainder of this document is structured as follows: first, in
{{cryptographic-deps}} and {{schemes}}, we define the abstractions on which
the schemes are built, and then the schemes themselves.  Then, in
{{security}}, we lay out the security analyses that support these
schemes, including the security requirements for constituent components
and the security notions satisfied by hybrid KEMS constructed according to
the schemes in the document {{security-requirements}}.  Finally, we discuss
some "path not taken", related topics that might be of interest to readers,
but which are not treated in depth.

# Requirements Notation

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Notation

This document is consistent with all terminology defined in
{{?I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.

The following terms are used throughout this document:

- `random(n)`: return a pseudorandom byte string of length `n` bytes produced
  by a cryptographically-secure random number generator.
- `concat(x0, ..., xN)`: Concatenation of byte strings.  `concat(0x01,
  0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- `split(N1, N2, x)`: Split a byte string `x` of length `N1 + N2` into its
  first `N1` bytes and its last `N2` bytes.  This function is the inverse of
  `concat(x1, x2)` when `x1` is `N1` bytes long and `x2` is `N2` bytes
  long. It is an error to call this function with a byte string that does not
  have length `N1 + N2`. Since this function operates over secret data `x`,
  it MUST be constant-time for a given `N1` and `N2`.

When `x` is a byte string, we use the notation `x[..i]` and `x[i..]` to
denote the slice of bytes in `x` starting from the beginning of `x` and
leading up to index `i`, including the `i`-th byte, and the slice the bytes
in `x` starting from index `i` to the end of `x`, respectively. For example,
if `x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `x[..2] = [0, 1]` and `x[2..] = [2, 3, 4]`.

# Cryptographic Dependencies {#cryptographic-deps}

The generic hybrid PQ/T KEM schemes we define depend on the the following
cryptographic primitives:

- Key Encapsulation Mechanisms ({{kems}})
- Nominal Groups ({{groups}})
- Pseudorandom Generators ({{prgs}})
- Key Derivation Functions ({{kdfs}})

In the remainder of this section, we describe functional aspects of these
mechanisms.  The security properties we require in order for the resulting
hybrid KEM to be secure are discussed in {{security}}.

A Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEMs) comprises the following algorithms:

- `GenerateKeyPair() -> (ek, dk)`: A randomized algorithm that generates a
  public encapsulation key `ek` and a secret decapsulation key `dk`, each of
  which are byte strings.
- `DeriveKeyPair(seed) -> (ek, dk)`: A deterministic algorithm that takes as
  input a seed `seed` and generates a public encapsulation key `ek` and a
  secret decapsulation key `dk`, each of which are byte strings.
- `Encaps(ek) -> (ct, ss)`: A probabilistic encapsulation
  algorithm, which takes as input a public encapsulation key `ek` and outputs
  a ciphertext `ct` and shared secret `ss`.
- `Decaps(dk, ct) -> ss`: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes
  as input a secret decapsulation key `dk` and ciphertext `ct` and outputs a
  shared secret `ss`.

We assume that the values produced and consumed by the above functions are
all byte strings, with fixed lengths:

- `Nseed`: The length in bytes of a key seed (input to DeriveKeyPair)
- `Nek`: The length in bytes of a public encapsulation key
- `Ndk`: The length in bytes of a secret decapsulation key
- `Nct`: The length in bytes of a ciphertext produced by Encaps
- `Nss`: The length in bytes of a shared secret produced by Encaps or Decaps

Nominal groups are an abstract model of elliptic curve groups, over which we
instantiate Diffie-Hellman key agreement {{ABH+21}}.  A nominal group
comprises a set `G` together with a distinguished basis element `g`, an
"exponentiation" map, and some auxiliary functions:

- `Exp(p, x) -> q`: An algorithm that produces an element `q` of `G` from an
  element `p` and an integer `x`.
    * The integers `x` are called "scalars" to distinguish them from group
      elements.
    * `Exp` must respect multiplication in its scalar argument `x`, so that
      `Exp(Exp(p, x), y) = Exp(p, x * y)`.
- `RandomScalar(seed) -> k`: Produce a uniform pseudo-random scalar from the
  byte string `seed`.
- `ElementToSharedSecret(P) -> ss`: Extract a shared secret from an element of
  the group (e.g., by taking the X coordinate of an ellpitic curve point).

We assume that scalars and group elements are represented by byte strings with
fixed lengths:

- `Nseed`: The length in bytes of a seed (input to RandomScalar)
- `Nscalar`: The length in bytes of a scalar
- `Nelem`: The length in bytes of a serialized group element
- `Nss`: The length in bytes of a shared secret produced by
  ElementToSharedSecret

The security requirements for groups used with the schemes in this document
are laid out in {{security-groups}}.

## Pseudorandom Generators {#prgs}

A pseudorandom generator (PRG) is a deterministic function `G` whose outputs
are longer than its inputs. When the input to `G` is chosen uniformly at
random, it induces a certain distribution over the possible output. The
output distribution is pseudorandom if it is indistinguishable from the
uniform distribution.

The PRGs used in this document have a simpler form, with a fixed
output lengths:

- `Nout` - The length in bytes of an output from this PRG.
- `PRG(seed) -> output`: Produce a byte string of length `Nout` from an input
  byte string `seed`.

The fixed sizes are for both security and simplicity.

MUST provide the bit-security required to source input randomness for PQ/T
components from a seed that is expanded to a output length, of which a subset
is passed to the component key generation algorithms.

The security requirements for PRGs used with the schemes in this document are
laid out in {{security-prgs}}.

## Key Derivation Functions {#kdfs}

A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is a function that a function that produces
keying material based on an input secret and other information.

While KDFs in the literature can typically consume and produce byte strings of
arbitrary length, the KDFs used in this document have a simpler form, with a fixed
output lengths:

- `Nout` - The length in bytes of an output from this KDF.
- `KDF(input) -> output`: Produce a byte string of length `Nout` from an input
  byte string.

The fixed sizes are for both security and simplicity.

For instances of the `Extract()`/`Expand()` KDF paradigm such as `HKDF`, we fix
the salt and sizes to fit this form.

The security requirements for KDFs used with the schemes in this document are
laid out in {{security-kdfs}}.

# Hybrid KEM Schemes {#schemes}

In this section, we define three generic schemes for building for hybrid
KEMs:

GHP:
: A generic scheme that is suitable for use with any choice of traditional and
  PQ KEMs, with minimal security assumptions on the constituent KEMs

PRE:
: A performance optimization of GHP for the case where encapsulation keys are
  large and frequently reused

QSF:
: An optimized generic scheme for the case where the traditional component is a
  nominal group and the PQ component has strong binding properties

These schemes share a common overall structure, differing mainly in how they
compute the final shared secret and the security requirements of their
components.

## GHP {#ghp}

The GHP hybrid KEM depends on the following constituent
components:

* `KEM_T`: A traditional KEM
* `KEM_PQ`: A post-quantum KEM
* `PRG`: A PRG producing byte strings of length `KEM_T.Nseed + KEM_PQ.Nseed`
  (`PRG.Nout == KEM_T.Nseed + KEM_PQ.Nseed`)
* `KDF`: A KDF producing byte strings of length `GHP.Nss` (`KDF.Nout
  == GHP.Nss`)
* `Label` - A byte string used to label the specific combination of the above
  constituents being used.

The KEMs, groups, KDFs, and PRGs MUST meet the security requirements in
{{security-requirements}}.

The constants associated with the hybrid KEM are mostly derived from the
concatenation of keys and ciphertexts:

~~~
Nek = KEM_T.Nek + KEM_PQ.Nek
Ndk = KEM_T.Ndk + KEM_PQ.Ndk
Nct = KEM_T.Nct + KEM_PQ.Nct
~~~

The `Nseed` and `Nss` constants should reflect the overall security level of the
combined KEM, with the following recommended values:

~~~
Nseed = max(KEM_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed)
Nss = min(KEM_T.Nss, KEM_PQ.Nss)
~~~

Given these constituent parts, the GHP hybrid KEM is defined as
follows:

~~~
def GenerateKeyPair():
    seed = random(Nseed)
    return DeriveKeyPair(seed)

def DeriveKeyPair(seed):
    seed_full = PRG(seed)
    (seed_T, seed_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed, seed)
    (ek_T, dk_T) = KEM_T.DeriveKeyPair(seed_T)
    (ek_PQ, dk_PQ) = KEM_PQ.DeriveKeyPair(seed_PQ)
    ek_H = concat(ek_T, ek_PQ)
    dk_H = concat(dk_T, dk_PQ)
    return (ek_H, dk_H)

def Encaps(ek):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nek, KEM_PQ.Nek, ek)
    (ss_T, ct_T) = KEM_T.Encap(pk_T)
    (ss_PQ, ct_PQ) = KEM_PQ.Encap(pk_PQ)
    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ek_PQ, ek_T, label))
    ct_H = concat(ct_T, ct_PQ)
    return (ss_H, ct_H)

def Decaps(dk, ct):
    (dk_T, dk_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Ndk, KEM_PQ.Ndk, dk)
    ek_T = KEM_T.ToEncaps(dk_T)
    ek_PQ = KEM_PQ.ToEncaps(dk_PQ)

    (ct_T, ct_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nct, KEM_PQ.Nct, ct)
    ss_T = KEM_T.Decap(dk_T, ct_T)
    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ek_PQ, ek_T, label))
    return ss_H
~~~

## PRE  {#pre}

The PRE hybrid KEM is a performance optimization of the GHP KEM,
optimized for the case where encapsulation keys are large and frequently
reused. In such cases, hashing the entire encapsulation key is expensive, and
the same value is hashed repeatedly.  The PRE KEM thus computes an
intermediate hash of the hybrid encapsulation key, so that the hash value can
be computed once and used across many encapsulation or decapsulation
operations.

The PRE KEM is identical to the GHP KEM except for the
shared secret computation.  One additional KDF is required:

* `KeyHash`: A KDF producing byte strings of length `GHP.Nss` (`KeyHash.Nout
  == GHP.Nss`)

The `GenerateKeyPair` and `DeriveKeyPair` algorithms for PRE are
identical to those of the GHP KEM.  The `Encaps` and `Decaps`
method use a modified shared secret computation:

~~~
def Encaps(ek):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nek, KEM_PQ.Nek, ek)
    (ss_T, ct_T) = KEM_T.Encap(pk_T)
    (ss_PQ, ct_PQ) = KEM_PQ.Encap(pk_PQ)

    ekh = KeyHash(concat(ek_T, ek_PQ))
    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ekh, label))

    ct_H = concat(ct_T, ct_PQ)
    return (ss_H, ct_H)

def Decaps(dk, ct):
    (dk_T, dk_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Ndk, KEM_PQ.Ndk, dk)
    ek_T = KEM_T.ToEncaps(dk_T)
    ek_PQ = KEM_PQ.ToEncaps(dk_PQ)

    (ct_T, ct_PQ) = split(KEM_T.Nct, KEM_PQ.Nct, ct)
    ss_T = KEM_T.Decap(dk_T, ct_T)
    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ekh = KeyHash(concat(ek_T, ek_PQ))
    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_PQ, ct_T, ekh, label))
    return ss_H
~~~

## QSF {#qsf}

The QSF hybrid KEM (QSF below) depends on the following constituent
components:

* `Group_T`: A nominal group
* `KEM_PQ`: A post-quantum KEM
* `PRG`: A PRG producing byte strings of length `Group_T.Nseed +
  KEM_PQ.Nseed` (`Expand.Nout == Group_T.Nseed + KEM_PQ.Nseed`)
* `KDF`: A KDF producing byte strings of length `QSF.Nss` (`KDF.Nout
  == KDF.Nss`)
* `Label` - A byte string used to label the specific combination of the above
  constituents being used.

We presume that `Group_T`, `KEM_PQ`, and the KDFs meet the interfaces
described in {{cryptographic-deps}} and MUST meet the security requirements
described in {{security-requirements}}.

The constants associated with the hybrid KEM are mostly derived from the
concatenation of keys and ciphertexts:

~~~
Nek = Group_T.Nelem + KEM_PQ.Nek
Ndk = Group_T.Nscalar + KEM_PQ.Ndk
Nct = Group_T.Nelem + KEM_PQ.Nct
~~~

The `Nseed` and `Nss` constants should reflect the overall security level of
the combined KEM, with the following recommended values:

~~~
Nseed = max(Group_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed)
Nss = min(Group_T.Nss, KEM_PQ.Nss)
~~~

Given these constituent parts, we define the QSF hybrid KEM as follows:

~~~
def GenerateKeyPair():
    seed = random(Nseed)
    return DeriveKeyPair(seed)

def DeriveKeyPair(seed):
    seed_full = PRG(seed)
    (seed_T, seed_PQ) = split(Group_T.Nseed, KEM_PQ.Nseed, seed)

    dk_T = Group_T.RandomScalar(seed_T))
    ek_T = Group_T.Exp(Group_T.g, dk_T)
    (ek_PQ, dk_PQ) = KEM_PQ.DeriveKeyPair(seed_PQ)

    ek_H = concat(ek_T, ek_PQ)
    dk_H = concat(dk_T, dk_PQ)
    return (ek_H, dk_H)

def Encaps(ek):
    (ek_T, ek_PQ) = split(Group_T.Nek, KEM_PQ.Nek, ek)

    sk_E = Group_T.RandomScalar(random(GroupT.Nseed))
    ct_T = Group_T.Exp(GroupT.g, sk_E)
    ss_T = Group_T.ElementToSharedSecret(Group_T.Exp(ek_T, sk_E))
    (ss_PQ, ct_PQ) = KEM_PQ.Encap(ek_PQ)

    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_T, ek_T, Label))
    ct_H = concat(ct_T, ct_PQ)
    return (ss_H, ct_H)

def Decaps(dk, ct):
    (dk_T, dk_PQ) = split(Group_T.Ndk, KEM_PQ.Ndk, dk)
    (ct_T, ct_PQ) = split(Group_T.Nct, KEM_PQ.Nct, ct)

    ek_T = Group_T.ToEncaps(dk_T)
    ek_PQ = KEM_PQ.ToEncaps(dk_PQ)

    ss_T = Group_T.ElementToSharedSecret(Group_T.Exp(ct_T, dk_T))
    ss_PQ = KEM_PQ.Decap(dk_PQ, ct_PQ)

    ss_H = KDF(concat(ss_PQ, ss_T, ct_T, ek_T, Label))
    return ss_H
~~~

# Security Considerations {#security}

Hybrid KEM constructions aim to provide security by combining two or more
schemes so that security is preserved if all but one schemes are replaced by
an arbitrarily bad scheme. Informally, these hybrid KEMs are secure if the
`KDF` is secure, and either the traditional component is secure, or the post-quantum
KEM is secure: this is the 'hybrid' property.

## Security Properties {#security-properties}

### IND-CCA Security {#ind-cca}

Also known as IND-CCA2 security for general public key encryption, for KEMs
that encapsulate a new random 'message' each time.

The notion of INDistinguishability against Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks
(IND-CCA) {{RS92}} is now widely accepted as the standard security notion for
asymmetric encryption schemes. IND-CCA security requires that no efficient
adversary can recognize which of two messages is encrypted in a given
ciphertext, even if the two candidate messages are chosen by the adversary
himself.

### Ciphertext Second Preimage Resistant (C2PRI) Security {#c2pri}

Also known in the literature as ciphertext collision resistance (CCR).

The notion where, even if a KEM has broken IND-CCA security (either due to
construction, implementation, or other), its internal structure, based on the
Fujisaki-Okamoto transform, guarantees that it is impossible to find a second
ciphertext that decapsulates to the same shared secret `K`: this notion is
known as ciphertext second preimage resistance (C2SPI) for KEMs
{{XWING}}. The same notion has also been described as chosen ciphertext
resistance elsewhere {{CDM23}}.

## Binding Properties {#binding-properties}

It is often useful for a KEM to have certain "binding properties", by which
certain parameters determine certain others {{CDM23}}.  These properties are
referred to with labels of the form X-BIND-P-Q.  For example, LEAK-BIND-K-PK
means that for a given shared secret (K), there is a unique encapsulation key
(PK) that could have produced it, even if all of the secrets involved are
given to the adversary after the encapsulation operation is completed (LEAK).

The property LEAK-BIND-K,PK-CT is related to the C2PRI property discussed
above.  Related to the ciphertext collision-freeness of the underlying PKE
scheme of a FO-transform KEM. Also called ciphertext collision resistance.

## Security Requirements for Constituent Components {#security-requirements}

### Security Requirements for KEMs {#security-kems}

Component KEMs MUST be IND-CCA-secure {{GHP2018}} {{XWING}}.

For instances of QSF, the component KEM MUST also be ciphertext second
preimage resistant (C2PRI) {{XWING}}: this allows the component KEM
encapsulation key and ciphertext to be left out from the KDF input.

### Security Requirements for Groups {#security-groups}

The groups MUST be modelable as nominal groups in which the strong
Diffie-Hellman problem holds {{ABH+21}} {{XWING}}.

The Montgomery curves Curve25519 and Curve448 have been shown to be modelable
as nominal groups in {{ABH+21}} as well as showing the `X25519()` and
`X448()` functions respectively pertain to the nominal group `exp(X, y)`
function, specifically clamping secret keys when they are generated, instead
of clamping secret keys together with exponentiation.

### Security Requirements for KDFs {#security-kdfs}

KDFs MUST be secure pseudorandom functions (PRFs) when keyed with the shared
secret output from the post-quantum IND-CCA-secure KEM component algorithm in
QSF {{XWING}} or any of the component IND-CCA-secure KEMs when used in
KitchenSink {{GHP2018}} or PreHash.

KDFs must be secure instances of random oracles in the ROM and QROM
{{GHP2018}} {{XWING}}. Proofs of indifferentiability from random oracles
{{MRH03}} give good confidence here, as any function proven indifferentiable
from a random oracle is resistant against collision, first, and second
preimage attacks. An indifferentiability bound
guarantees security against specific attacks. Although indifferentiability
does not capture all properties of a random oracle {{RSS11}},
indifferentiability still remains the best way to rule out structural
attacks.

Sponge-based constructions such as SHA-3 have been shown to be
indifferentiable against classical {{BDP+08}} as well as quantum adversaries
{{ACM+25}}.

HKDF has been shown to be indifferentiable from a random oracle under
specific constraints {{LBB20}}:

- that HMAC is indifferentiable from a random oracle,
which for HMAC-SHA-256 has been shown in {{DRS+13}}, assuming the
compression function underlying SHA-256 is a random oracle,
which it is indifferentiably when used prefix-free.

- the values of `HKDF`'s `IKM` input do not collide with
values of `info` `||` `0x01`. This MUST be enforced by the
concrete instantiations that use `HKDF` as its KDF.

The choice of the KDF security level SHOULD be made based on the
security level provided by the constituent KEMs. The KDF SHOULD
at least have the security level of the strongest constituent KEM.

### Security Requirements for PRGs {#security-prgs}

The functions used to expand a key seed to multiple key seeds is closer to a
pseudorandom generator (PRG) in its security requirements {{AOB+24}}. A
secure PRG is an algorithm PRG : {0, 1}^n → {0, 1}^m, such that no
polynomial-time adversary can distinguish between PRG(r) (for r $← {0, 1}^n)
and a random z $← {0, 1}^m {{Rosulek}}. The uniform string r ∈ {0, 1}^n is
called the seed of the PRG.

A PRG is not to be confused with a random (or pseudorandom) _number_
generator (RNG): a PRG requires the seed randomness to be chosen uniformly
and extend it; an RNG takes sources of noisy data and transforms them into
uniform outputs.

A PRG is a particular mode of use of a random oracle {{BDP+11}}.  Examples
used in such a manner include SHAKE256.

## Security Properties of Hybrid KEMs

All generic constructions in this document produce IND-CCA-secure KEMs
when correctly instantiated concretely with cryptographic components that
meet the respective security requirements. Any changes to the routines,
including key generation/derivation, are not guaranteed to produce
secure results.

## Other Considerations

### Domain Separation {#domain-separation}

ASCII-encoded bytes provide oracle cloning {{BDG2020}} in the security game
via domain separation. The IND-CCA security of hybrid KEMs often relies on
the KDF function `KDF` to behave as an independent random oracle, which the
inclusion of the `label` achieves via domain separation {{GHP2018}}.

By design, the calls to `KDF` in these schemes and usage anywhere else
in higher level protoocl use separate input domains unless intentionally
duplicating the 'label' per concrete instance with fixed paramters. This
justifies modeling them as independent functions even if instantiated by the
same KDF. This domain separation is achieved by using prefix-free sets of
`label` values. Recall that a set is prefix-free if no element is a prefix of
another within the set.

Length diffentiation is sometimes used to achieve domain separation but as a
technique it is brittle and prone to misuse {{BDG2020}} in practice so we
favor the use of an explicit post-fix label.

### Fixed-length

Variable-length secrets are generally dangerous. In particular, using key
material of variable length and processing it using hash functions may result
in a timing side channel. In broad terms, when the secret is longer, the hash
function may need to process more blocks internally. In some unfortunate
circumstances, this has led to timing attacks, e.g. the Lucky Thirteen
[LUCKY13] and Raccoon [RACCOON] attacks.

Furthermore, [AVIRAM] identified a risk of using variable-length secrets when
the hash function used in the key derivation function is no longer
collision-resistant.

If concatenation were to be used with values that are not fixed-length, a
length prefix or other unambiguous encoding would need to be used to ensure
that the composition of the two values is injective and requires a mechanism
different from that specified in this document.

Therefore, this specification MUST only be used with algorithms which have
fixed-length shared secrets.

# Out of Scope

Considerations that were considered and not included in these designs:

Anonymity {{GMP22}}, Deniability, Obfuscation, other forms of key-robustness
or binding {{GMP22}}, {{CDM23}}

## More than Two Component KEMs

Design team decided to restrict the space to only two components, a
traditional and a post-quantum KEM.

## Parameterized Output Length

Not analyzed as part of any security proofs in the literature, and a
complicatation deemed unnecessary.

# Deterministic Encapsulation

When verifying the behavior of a KEM implementation (e.g., by generating or
verifying test vectors), it is useful for the implementation to expose a
"derandomized" version of the `Encaps` algorithm:

- `EncapsDerand(ek, randomness) -> (ct, shared_secret)`: A deterministic
   encapsulation algorithm, which takes as input a public encapsulation key
   `ek` and randomness `randomness`, and outputs a ciphertext `ct` and shared
   secret `shared_secret`.

An implementation that exposes EncapsDerand must also define a required amount
of randomness:

- `Nrandom`: The length in bytes of the randomness provided to EncapsDerand

The corresponding change for a nominal group is to replace randomly-generated
inputs to RandomScalar with deterministic ones.  In other words, for a nominal
group, `Nrandom = Nseed`.

When a hybrid KEM is instantiated with constituents that support derandomized
encapsulation (either KEMs or groups), the hybrid KEM can also support
EncapsDerand, with `Nrandom = T.Nrandom + PQ.Nrandom`.  The structure of the
hybrid KEM's EncapsDerand algorithm is the same as its `Encaps` method, with the
following differences:

* The EncapsDerand algorithm also takes a `randomness` parameter, which is a
  byte string of length `Nrandom`.
* Invocations of Encaps or RandomScalar (with a random input) in the constituent
  algorithms are replaced with calls ot EncapsDerand or RandomScalar with a
  deterministic input.
* The randomness used by the traditional constituent is the first `T.Nrandom`
  bytes of the input randomness.
* The randomness used by the PQ constituent is the final `PQ.Nrandom` bytes of
  the input randomness.
